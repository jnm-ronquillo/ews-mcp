"""Regression tests for Bug 1 — search_emails silently dropped query/sender.

Before: calling ``search_emails`` with ``query="foo"`` or ``sender="x"``
(both advertised in the tool's schema) fell through the filter-build
whitelist. Log said ``No filters or date range provided. Limiting to
last 30 days.`` and 9 identical requests returned the same default
inbox slice.

After:
* The free-text ``query`` param applies subject-OR-body substring filter.
* ``sender``/``recipient`` aliases for ``from_address``/``to_address``
  now take effect.
* Unknown params raise ValidationError (HTTP 400), not silent drop.
